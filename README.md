avl-crrcsim-editor
==================

An editor for AVL (Athena Vortex Lattice) and a exporter for Crrcsim simulator

Install first avl 3.35 from here http://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/avl/

[Download](https://github.com/TLmaK0/avl-crrcsim-editor/releases/latest)

And select avl path in Edit->Set AVL executable

Create your airplane, and then export as AVL file or CRRCsim Xml.

This software is in a early beta fase, so be careful with the result.

Please, help me to improve it.
